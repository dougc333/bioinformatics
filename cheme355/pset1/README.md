modify trna-anticodon from forming hairpin shape which will dropoff
(maybe can leave)
modify trna to attach to foreign AA (nucleotide editing)
modify/create existing enxyme to tran-foreignAA

problem is if you modify existing stop codons; stop codon functionality
wont be as reliable. increses error rate of protein synthesis and 
can kill cell or reduce output significantly.

will alter existing stop codon functionality. will affect gene
expression in other geenes. unknoown effet
