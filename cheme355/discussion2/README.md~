PCR Review:
Goal: amplify DNA sequences
1) denature by heat to separate strands
2) cut the strands. 


why do you need a PCR priemr? to start reads from a known location. 
write up PCR primer design and PCR lab docs
how long are the PCR primers?


Index adapters: for illumina sequencers where only 1 NT is attached at a time for sequencing.
