    "In nature you have bacteria which takes in glucose and outputs xanthan\n",
    "change this to take in lactose output xanthan\n",

    "We need\n",
    "<li>1) enzyme to convert lactose (sugar dimer) to individual companents, glusocse. ecoli has genes to do this.\n",
    "enzyme lacz can break up lactose to glucose, there is gene in ecoli which does this. </li>\n",
    "<li>2) protein for importing lacose, ecoli membrane allows you take in lactose, there is another piece of DNA allowing\n",
    "this</li>\n",
    "<li>3) source of genes for 1 and 2. </li> Cant just stick in genes into an organism and expect them to work. Need\n",
    "something to transcribe them. You use a PXc or promoter to start the mRNA transcription that you borrow from another\n",
    "organism, a virus, a Xanthamanos phage.\n",
    "<li>4) something to turn on the gene. (add promoter region to DNA)</li>\n",
    "<li>5) way to make/confirm piece of DNA</li>\n",
    "<li>6) get DNA into Xc cell</li>\n",
    "<li>7) test you get 4g/liter of Xanthan for 5g/L of lactose</li>\n",

    "4 main biopolymers to make cells, 1) proteins, 20 AA where an AA is connected via peptide bond to make protein polymers\n",
    "2) Nucleic acids, nucleotides connected w H bonds and diphosphorbond. 3) carbohydrates/polysaccharide, 4) Fatty acids/lipids\n",
    "there are 500 AA but only 20 make proteins. makes sense protein polymer made of amide bonds. \n",
    "hat if they were built on esters and they could hydrolize easily. want to the protein polymers \n",
    "to be difficult to breakdown in contrast to biopolymers nucleic acids.  \n",
    "proteins used for catalysis, structure (algen),transport. \n",

    "what are carbohydrates used for in cell? energy storae. store carbon. use for structure, xanthan gum is sturcture of biofilm in cell.\n",
