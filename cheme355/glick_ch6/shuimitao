Don't I have to pay you?
Yes! All orders are to be accompanied by payment of the invoice amount by check or money order payable to “The Arboreum Company.” Unfortunately we are not equipped to receive payments by credit card yet.

What happens next?
First we must determine that we can fulfill your order. If we discover we can’t complete all of your order, we will call or email you to see if you would like to substitute with a different variety. We do not create backorders for the next season’s delivery (not all varieties are propagated each year). We refund instead.

Charges associated with agricultural certifications or custom shipping will be advised by the confirming email, and your order as confirmed will not be shipped until payment in full is received. If payment is not received by end of our shipping season, your order is cancelled, and payment refunded to you.

We deliver the goods
Once everything is paid for, we pack up your fruit trees and ship ’em out!
