Describe a protocol for producing a therapeutic agent that targets and kills a specific cell type. 13.  How would you engineer TNF- α  to be a more specific and effective anticancer agent? 14.  What would you do to make interleukin-10 more effective for treating inflammatory bowel disease? 15.  How can the gene for DNase I be manipulated so that the enzyme becomes more effective for treating cystic fibrosis patients? 16.  How would you develop a strategy to protect at-risk women from HIV infection? 17.  How might low levels of phenylalanine be attained, other than with a phenylalanine-free diet, in patients with the human genetic disease phenylketonuria? 18.  What types of genetic manipulations can be used to generate a very large bacterial library of highly specific singlechain human monoclonal antibodies? 19.  How would you engineer a mouse so that it produces only human antibodies? 20.  What is a bispecific diabody? 21.  How would you design a short peptide so that it retains the antigen-binding specificity of an entire immunoglobulin molecule? 22.  How would select antibodies against specific antigens in E. coli? 23.  What are dual-variable-domain immunoglobulins? \n",
