javascript class design
https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/blob/master/lib/index.js


there are no classes in JS. But there is a class keyword and
new keyword which sure look like classes/objects. 
you can use a javascript class or a prototype to define a library

class A{} //typeof(A) is function

they implement classes w/functions. But classes and funcitons
behave differently

inheritance in JS uses the child.prototype to connect to the
parent.prototype. super() works how? 

a protottpe is a working object instance. what the hell does 
this mean?
