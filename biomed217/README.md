the model of prognosis in the intro slides don't use deep learning
extracting patterns for cancer survivabliity

early examples 2002 Nature Van't veer.. predicting outcome of cancer patients using gene expression data
from microarray 

there are many disease signatures from sequencing. These are not unique signatures
stored in MSigDB, GeneSigDB
additional use case for signature: genet set enrichment analysis


evaluation of prognostics models:
overfitting
curse of dimensionality
noise in data

need rigorous preprocessing strategy
signal/noise is low
batch correction to eliminate technical effects on parameters

need rigorous validation strategy 
cross validataion(for overfitting)
randomization strategy
